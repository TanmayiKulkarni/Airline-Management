# Airline-Management
This is a group project made in the first year of my college.
<br>
It is a simple implementation of a airline management system named as Voyage airlines. It has 4 travel destinations(to and fro). It accepts the travel date along with location and displays all the flight options that are available and also tells which option is cheapest and which option is fastest. If the user want to book a ticket then it accepts the number of passengers and then the details of each passenger. Validation of information is performed. Asks which class the customer want to travel- economy or business. If economy is selected then a 8X8 matrix of seating arrangement is displayed and the user is asked to enter the seat number of his/her choice after booking the seat number is replaced by '*'. If business class is selected a 5X5 matrix is displayed. If the person who is traveling is physically challenged we offer him assistance if required. Finally the payment method is accepted which is just a simulation. Tickets are displayed with a unicode and barcode on it along with the customer details.
